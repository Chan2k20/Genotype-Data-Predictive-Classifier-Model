# Feature selection (Machine learning)

Performed feature selection using f-score method without using the library in python on a simulated dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data containing 29623 SNPs (total features), 4000 cases and 4000 controls as training dataset to extract the important features.

Build and train a linear SVM model on the selected features from f-score to predict the outcome of 2000 test individuals. The model is then optimized to achieve an accuracy above 63%.

The output was the total number of features and the feature column numbers that were used for final prediction.
