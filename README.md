# MachineLearning_Feature_selection

Feature selection(F-Score) method on a simulated dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data containing 29623 SNPs (total features), 4000 cases and 4000 controls for the training, and the features were fed to linear SVM model to predict the outcome of 2000 test individuals. 
The output was the total number of features and the feature column numbers that were used for final prediction. 
The accuracy was measured by number of features and model was able to achieve accuracy above 63%
